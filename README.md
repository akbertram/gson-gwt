GSON-GWT
########

This library provides GWT "emulated" sources for the JsonElement classes in the
[Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) library.

These emulated sources are used Java-to-Javascript compile time and implement
the JsonElement using Javascript objects.

This makes it possible to share code that uses the JsonElement classes
between the server and the client.
